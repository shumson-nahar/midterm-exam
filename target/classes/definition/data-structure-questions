Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
 A. Data structures are important to all programmers. They help us memory efficiently,they help us model processes


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?

 A. Insertion,Deletion,Traversal,Searching,Sorting.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
 A. Data structures are used in any program or software.
 They are used in the areas of.
Compiler Design.
Operating System.
DBMS
Graphics.
Simulation.
Numerical Analysis.

what is an Array?

 A. An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?

 An array is a fixed_length data structure. ArrayList is a variable-length data structure.

what is LinkedList?
A linkedList is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node consists of two parts, i.e.,data and address.
Array elements store in a contiguous memory location.
Linked list elements can be stored anywhere in the memory or randomly stored.

what is queue?
Queue is a collection of ordered elements .


what is stack?
A. stack is a conceptual structure consisting of a set of homogeneous elements and is based on the principle of last
in first out .
what is FIFO and LIFO?
The Last-In, First-out(LIFO) method assumes that the last unit to arrive in inventory or more recent is sold first.
The First-In,First-Out(FIFO) method assumes that the oldest unit of inventory is the sold first.

what is the order of complexity?
The time complexity of a loop is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is to be executed.
 On the first iteration of i=0, the inner loop executes 0 times. On the first iteration of i=1, the inner loop executes 1 times

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
The best case complexity is 0(1)when element is first or last element in the array.
Java.
Python3.
Javascript.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
The worst case complexity is 0(n/2) (equivalent to 0(n)) when element is in the middle or not present in the array.
what is tree in data structure?
A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner.

what is graph in data structure?
A graph is a non-linear kind of data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.
HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
1.RDBMS=Array(i.e.Array of structures)
2.Network data model = Graph
3.Hierarchical data model= Trees

How HashMap works in java?
HashMap uses multiple buckets and each bucket points to a Singly Linked List where the entries (nodes) are stored.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
There are mainly four different ways to copy all elements of one array into another array in Java.
1. Manually.
2. Arrays.copyOf()
3. System.arraycopy()
4. Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?

 A. An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node where node consists of two parts, i.e. data and address.
Array elements store in a contiguous memory location.
Linked list elements can be stored anywhere in the memory or randomly stored.

What is DFS and BFS?

 A. BFS stands for Breadth First Search. DFS stands for Depth First Search.BFS uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path.
DFS uses Stack data structure.

What is Recursion?
 A. Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself.
This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?

 A. In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every elements are attached to
 its previous and next adjacent. In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
 A. Big O Notation is a way to describe the speed or complexity of a given algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
 A. Selection Sort,Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bucket Sort , Radix Sort,  Count Sort.


Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
